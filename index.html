    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Written by Bermet Ibraeva</h2>
    <p>My name is Bermet, which means “pearl” in Kyrgyz.
        My hobbies include reading fiction and fanfiction, walking, and cooking.
        I am also a big anime fan.
        I am not a strong developer, but I am more oriented toward problem-solving and product-focused work.
        I enjoy specific tasks where I can use my creativity.
